Part 1 - Scrap Titles and Preview from Mars News

In part_1_mars_news.ipynb, the Mars NASA website was visited. BeautifulSoup was used to extract the text elements title and preview of the news articles. These extracted text elements pairs were then put in a dictionary with the keys title and preview. The dictionaries were then placed into a Python list, which is printed in the Jupyter notebook. 

Part 2 - Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

In part_2_mars_news.ipynb, the Mars Temperature Data Site was visited. BeautifulSoup was used to extract the data from all rows of the table. That data was then stored in a python list so that a Pandas DataFrame could be built with it. The data types of each column were then changed from object to datetime, int, and float. The data was then analyzed to answer the five provided questions and plot graphs. A CSV file was created with the data from the DataFrame.
